REPEATED SUBSTRING
==================

CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:
----------------------

You are to find the longest repeated substring in a given text. Repeated
substrings may not overlap. If more than one substring is repeated with the
same length, print the first one you find.(starting from the beginning of the
text).

NOTE: The substrings can't be all spaces.

INPUT SAMPLE:
-------------

Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. The
input file contains several lines. Each line is one test case. Each line
contains a test string. E.g.
::

   banana
   am so uniqe

OUTPUT SAMPLE:
--------------

For each set of input produce a single line of output which is the longest
repeated substring. If there is none, print out the string NONE. E.g.
::

   an
   NONE
