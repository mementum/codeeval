LONGEST COMMON SUBSEQUENCE
==========================

CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:
----------------------

You are given two sequences. Write a program to determine the longest common
subsequence between the two strings (each string can have a maximum length of
50 characters). NOTE: This subsequence need not be contiguous. The input file
may contain empty lines, these need to be ignored.

INPUT SAMPLE:
-------------

The first argument will be a path to a filename that contains two strings per
line, semicolon delimited. You can assume that there is only one unique
subsequence per test case. E.g.
::

  XMJYAUZ;MZJAWXU

OUTPUT SAMPLE:
--------------

The longest common subsequence. Ensure that there are no trailing empty spaces
on each line you print. E.g.
::

  MJAU
