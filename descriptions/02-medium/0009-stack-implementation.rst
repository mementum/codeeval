STACK IMPLEMENTATION
====================

CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:
----------------------

Write a program which implements a stack interface for integers. The interface
should have ‘push’ and ‘pop’ functions. Your task is to ‘push’ a series of
integers and then ‘pop’ and print every alternate integer.

INPUT SAMPLE:
-------------

Your program should accept a file as its first argument. The file contains a
series of space delimited integers, one per line.

For example:
::
   1 2 3 4
   10 -2 3 4

OUTPUT SAMPLE:
--------------

Print to stdout every alternate space delimited integer, one per line.

For example:
::
   4 2
   4 -2
